# Step 6 - Generating the Data Encryption Config and Key

Scripts, etc for [Step 6](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/06-data-encryption-keys.md).

`gen-configs.sh` takes all the scripts from that page and puts them into one script, driven off the outputs from the main Terraform script in `../step-03-provisioning` which creates all the GCP resources.
