# Step 5 - Configuration Files

Scripts, etc for [Step 5](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/05-kubernetes-configuration-files.md).

`gen-configs.sh` takes all the scripts from that page and puts them into one script, driven off the outputs from the main Terraform script in `../step-03-provisioning` which creates all the GCP resources.
